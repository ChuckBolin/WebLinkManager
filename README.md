WebLinkManager
==============
NOTE: This is a learning project, my first one of any substance. 03.2014

Android app to manage web links (similar to a bookmark manager but doesn't work with bookmarks).

The Main activity accesses secondary activities with 5 buttons (add, delete, edit, show, and email). The user
selects an item in the listview and clicks one of the buttons.

Each item in the list is a description of a specific web link. The email button formats the web link and description 
places it into an email.
